# RAP
RAP is a rank aggregation-based data fusion approach for gene prioritization in plants. It  can be used to perform the gene prioritization in Arabidopsis thaliana and 28 non-plant species. The input of RAP are a set of genes of interest and the network-based gene prioritization results from AraNet v2 system, while the output are the ranks of candidate genes. RAP has been successfully applied to prioritize flowering-time genes in Arabidopsis. The genome-wide experimental results indicate that RAP can be used as a complement to the network-based gene prioritization algorithm (e.g., AraNet v2) for accurately prioritizing candidate genes underlying biological processes or agricultural traits.
