Description: RAP can be used to perform the gene prioritization in Arabidopsis thaliana 
             and 28 non-plant species. The input of RAP are a set of genes of interest and
	     the network-based gene prioritization results from AraNet v2 system, while the
	     output are the ranks of candidate genes. RAP has been successfully applied to
	     prioritize flowering-time genes in Arabidopsis. The genome-wide experimental
	     results indicate that RAP can be used as a complement to the network-based gene
	     prioritization algorithm (e.g., AraNet v2) for accurately prioritizing candidate
	     genes underlying biological processes or agricultural traits.
